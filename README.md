# Datamine Studio/Python ⬅️ Datamine Studio/JS

The **Datamine Scripting** feature has been widely used in the mining industry for decades. Traditionally, it integrates Datamine Studio with JavaScript (JS) through **Microsoft’s Component Object Model (COM)**, a technology supported on Windows OS.

Since COM is compatible with multiple programming languages, **Datamine Scripting can also be used through Python integration**. This enables the use of Python’s powerful features, widely adopted in Data Science, such as:

- Plotting charts;
- Building complex data validation and analysis workflows;
- Embedding Machine Learning workflows.

If you are already familiar with Datamine Scripting via JS, this material will be very helpful. Throughout this notebook, we will explore **examples of Datamine Scripting functionalities using JS, each followed by a corresponding example in Python**.
